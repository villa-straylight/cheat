# Example

SAVEIFS=$IFS  
IFS=$(echo -en "\n\b")  
<Whatever weird crap you arere trying to do>
IFS=$SAVEIFS 

# Explanation
- $IFS is the Internal Field Seprator
- Setting it to \n\b sets it to line end rather than space
- We save the current variable and then set it back at the end
- This is so we do not blow anything up
